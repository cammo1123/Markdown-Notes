## Provide an outline of how  Amrad Pty Ltd ripped off indigenous people

Use the following resource: [The Great Indigenous Rip-Off](https://www.greatreporter.com/content/great-indigenous-rip)

### Who are Amrad?

Amrad is a Victorian Drug company

### What do Amrad do?

Using the provided resouce I concluded that they work with aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory to investigate rare plants in the Northern Territory

### What are the concerns for Indigenous people?

If the drug is sucsesfully commercialized the Western Australian government would probably earn about $100,000,000 in royalties a year... Nearly None of which would go to benefit the aboriginal communities

### What is Indigenous intellectual property (IP) and how does this affect their working with pharmaceutical companies?
